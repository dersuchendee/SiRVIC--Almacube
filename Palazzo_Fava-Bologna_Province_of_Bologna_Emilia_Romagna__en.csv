"This exhibition was on when we were in Bologna, and it was a waste of time and money. It was mostly video and lights with some of Vivaldi's music, and we were done in less than an hour.","August 29, 2019"
"In Palazzo Fava we visited retrospective ""Moni Paralleli"" of Bologna-born painter Sergio Vacchi (1925-2016). This self-taught artist, with admiration for Giorgio de Chirico and Giorgio Morandi, Otto Dix and other artist, and inspired by contemporary authors and movie stars, had surrealistic approach, with 'own signature'. The exhibitition shows his approach towards the dual or parallel nature of the world. A great series of works demonstrate his research of Francis Bacon, Max Ernst, De Chirico, and his interest in portrait painting of people that inspired him (like Greta Garbo) as well as the investigation of the outside world that surround the human. Really worth a visit...to those interested in some surreal undertone in art.","October 16, 2018"
"Went there to see an exhibition on Edward Hopper 2 years ago when I visited Bologna. It was very good. Staff were very friendly. I also enjoyed coffee and some iced chocolate bar at the on site cafe there.This time, I went to see an exhibition on 'Metamorphosis - Zhang Dali'. Comparatively speaking, I enjoyed the exhibition on Edward Hopper more. A ticket costs €10 (audioguide included), and with it, I got a €2 reduction when I visited the Storia di Bologna at Palazzo Pepoli (another Genus Bononiae venue).Recommended if there's an exhibition of interest to you. You can check out the frescoes by the Carracci brothers, (famous Bolognese artists of the 16th century) there when you visit.","May 17, 2018"
"We visited the Astrid Kirchherr with The Beatles exhibition on Saturday. The exhibition was wonderful with lots of great stories on the handheld set, which is included in the ticket price. The space is great. The staff were very friendly and informative. I will definitely be visiting future exhibitions here. Highly recommend a visit to the Astrid Kirchherr exhibition is you are in Bologna!","September 19, 2017"
Not only do you get to see the exhibition current at the time of your visit but you also get to see the painted room interiors by the Carracci Brothers famous bolognese artists of 16 century,"June 16, 2017"
"Erm, didn't actually get as far as the museum space. Waylaid by the excellent coffee and books in the hip & highbrow cafe. Great place do hang out and feel cultured without having to actually look at anything.","May 9, 2017"
"I'm relatively new to the world of early/mid 20th-century Italian art, but I love it, and therefore I was interested to see Costruire Il Novecento.What a wonderful exhibit! Beyond simply enjoying the paintings aesthetically, I was particularly happy to discover the work of Osvaldo Licini and to learn more about Giorgio Morandi and Carlo Carrà. In fact, one element I loved about this show was how much I learned via the (free) informative audio guide. Guests may listen to individual recordings for most paintings, and additional informational tracks are available for those wanting more background information about the artist. [As an aside, I will say I used the Italian language guide, but I'd be shocked if it wasn't available in English as well.] Each room also features dual Italian/English placards describing the artwork, artists and brief historical context.I was so happy with the exhibit, that I promptly bought the show catalogue at the gift shop. (Which, by the way, has a number of nice little ""gifts"" for the folks back home.)If you're looking for a pleasant way to spend an hour or so in Bologna, I highly recommend Costruire Il Novecento.P.S. Look up from time-to-time...some of the ceilings of Palazzo Fava are beautiful! :-)","March 11, 2017"
It currently has the Vermeer exhibition which was a must for me and I was not disappointed. Absolutely beautiful.,"September 26, 2016"
We visited there the Edward Hopper exhibition. It gave us a complete overview of Hopper’s production. The Nighthawks was missing.,"August 21, 2016"
"I visited on the last day of the Edward Hopper exhibition facilitated by the Whitney Museum of American Art in Manhattan, and the 60 minute wait in the queue was absolutely worth it. The contrast between the superb Renaissance frescoes and ceiling above and Hopper's distinctive perspective and colours below were just stunning! I did not have time to visit the Medieval museum in the other wing but left a very happy man nonetheless. What a priceless space for art exhibitions ...","July 27, 2016"
"We went to see the Edward Hopper exhibition which was excellent. We stayed for longer than expected, the audio guide was really informative and brought the paintings to life. However the building itself has amazing architecture and it's worth looking past the art on display to see the rooms themselves. A good shop back on the ground floor, but only 1 ladies toilet which meant queues.","July 20, 2016"
"My four-dot review is due exclusively to the fact that this palace which was elegantly restored and has been and is the house of many important exhibits--I went to see recently the exhibit on Hopper--has only a miser bathroom for women and one for me. I think they could have been more generous in the allocations for bathrooms, especially knowing that the ladies' toilets are always crowded and with a huge line.Having said that, the palace is really beautiful, with great frescoes on the ceilings of its rooms, which created a nice contrast to the painting by Hopper, when I went to visit his exhibit this past June.","July 2, 2016"
"confession - I love Hopper so it was a thrill to see that he'd be in Bologna when we were. Lots of pepole have commented on this particular exhibition so I will just say that, if you like Hopper I'd suggest you take in the Morandi exhibition up at Mambo to get a conmparison of the way that the two use geometrical shapes to form their conmporsiions. But..... the biulding - honestly just a confection - as you wander around whatever show you are there to see, make suer you check out the walls and ceilings for some exquisite (and in places really creepy) murals. We loved it and, what with the show and werw there for almost 3 hours. but that's alldown to the way you do these things so many will slip through in less than an hour..word of warning - they control access quite carefully - we were told we'd have to wait 15 minutes so decided to go for gelato..... there is an excellent place (recommended by the chap on the door at Palazzo Fava) nearby.... one of a chain of two (the other being near the two towers) - this one is less busy - little salon at the back to eat you ice cream - will review separately....","June 12, 2016"
Take time out from the shops and visit the Palazzo Fava we called to see the Edward Hopper exhibition which was fantastic. A nice change from food and shops also check out the church across the street a real surprise awaits you inside.,"May 19, 2016"
"This is on at the Palazzo Fava till 24 July 2016, and is first-rate. Very informative and well curated, I certainly learned to appreciate Hopper's importance as a 20th century painter beyond his being a chronicler of American scenes and situations.","April 15, 2016"
"We had a beautiful exhibition in the palace ""Da Cimabue a Morandi"": This is a summary of the bolognaise paintings, and it is an excellent exhibition. But you should visit the palace itself, with it wonderful frescos, paintings. Great!","August 26, 2015"
"We visited a beutiful expositon at the Palazzo delle Espositioni, the Palazzo Fava. The paitings were excellent and they had been arranged in an interewsting way. The entranceprice was not cheap, but afterwards we noticed the ticket was 48 hours valid and gave entrenace to 4 different musea. A nice initiative, but not for uw, given the fact we we leaving Bologna that night.","May 29, 2015"
"Palazzo Fava is my favorite spot to go to in Bologna, I never feel bored of it no matter how often I visit it .They always have something special/ interesting to see every time I go. Recently, they have a new exhibition called ""Da Cimabue a Morandi"" and I found it's spectacular! I highly recommend you to cheeck it out. You won't feel disappointed! I swear!","May 24, 2015"
"The Palazzo Fava is worth visiting just to see the interior - there are some beautifully restored fresco paintings on the ceilings. They have changing exhibitions; when I visited they were exhibiting some Max Klinger prints. I'd never heard of this artist before, and there was no information in English, but I spent a fascinating hour or so going round. It left me wanting to find out more about him, so I suppose it achieved its objective.Entry is free if you have a Bologna Welcome Card.","November 28, 2014"
I visited this palace during The Girl with a Pearl Earring exhibit. This palace would deserve a better attention. Looking at the ceiling you may spot some paintings almost disappeared and wonder why nothing was done to preserve them. A pity.,"July 12, 2014"
"We visited Bologna specifically to see the Palazzo Fava exhibition. It was publicised as being primarily a Vermeer exhibition which it wasn't as it had only two Vermeers with all the rest of the exhibits being by other Dutch masters. There were a number of fine Rembrandt portraits and a Hals as well as landscapes, pictures with biblical themes and peasant lives by other artists. Of course, the highlight was to see the luminous ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"" in real life although it was a little disappointing that even though there are only 35 of his known works, there were so few Vermeers at what was advertised as being primarily a Vermeer exhibition.To avoid long queues it is a good idea to pre-book.","May 22, 2014"
"This was a highlight of my trip to Bologna. The staff were well trained in several languages and the paintings were spectacular! It is up several uneven stairs, be careful!! It was beautifully done in 5 rooms. You will have to check everything ( no purses, cellphones, backpacks, cameras, any bags you have with you ) it is free, and the line moves fast with lots of people to help! Go soon, it ends on May 25-2014..","May 22, 2014"
"Since we made reservations, we did not have to wait in line, and it was exciting to see the ""The Girl with a Pearl Earring"" in person. But overall, the exhibit was a disappointment. My bad for not doing the research, but I was expecting more than two Vermeers. The works inspired by Vermeer were a waste of time. This exhibit did not justify a day trip from Florence.","May 8, 2014"
"There are a lot of negative reviews of this Vermeer and other Dutch masters' exhibition, many of which are totally unjustified. As there are still 3 weeks left of the exhibition, some tips and points:Book in advance: many people are complaining about having to stand in an interminable queue to see this exhibition. Well, as The Girl with the Pearl Earring is the star attraction, in the top three of the most famous and recognisable artworks ever (after the Mona Lisa and The Scream), then it's hardly surprising most of northern Italy (and the rest of the world it seems) want to see it. The online booking system is easy, fast and saves you a long long wait. A no-brainer.Book an audio-guide. It's true that the exhibition's lighting is at times dim, which makes it difficult to read the information panels (only in Italian), so book an audio-guide (in Italian or English) and let them guide you - very informative, very well done - the exhibition would have been a lot less stimulating without it.The organisation was spot on - if you book, you have a 20-minute window to turn up, and the door people are very strict, which makes sense. Once you're in, you can be there all day if you want, so ignore all the other reviews that say you only have 20 minutes to see the exhibition.Yes, the exhibition is small, and there are a lot of people and the groups are very annoying, especially if led by hysterical group leaders. But the groups move on very quickly, and suddenly you have the section (almost) to yourself. If you can manage to be patient, you can see all the paintings for as long as you like with little hassle.Other points: a wonderful but small collection of paintings, from Vermeer (yes, only two paintings, but if there's The Girl with the Pearl Earring, what more could you want?) and Rembrandt to, I admit the star of the show, Fabritius's the Goldfinch, recently the protagonist of Donna Tartt's superlative novel. The exhibition is extremely well organised and works like clockwork - checking in our bags at the cloakroom was swift and efficient, getting the (prebooked) audioguides was a 20 second job, the little shop sold everything you could ever desire with the Girl with the Pearl Earring on - I mean, what's not to like?I have only given 4 stars as I felt there were too many people, and I agree that perhaps the rooms were not organised very coherently, but the exhibition and Palazzo Fava are both very small, so the advantage is you can easily double back and go and revisit any paintings you may want to see again.For anyone who can manage to get to Bologna before 25 May when the exhibition closes, you should take make the most of it and see this exhibition (but book online first!!) Oh, and all the hundreds and thousands and millions of reproductions of the Girl with the Pearl Earring don't do it justice whatsoever, so seeing it ""in the flesh"" as it were, is pretty mind-blowing. In the end, it's a once in a lifetime opportunity to see a collection like this, so it's more than worth the few mere inconveniences that such an exhibition causes, which is why I can not but recommend going to Palazzo Fava to see the Girl with the Pearl Earring and all her friends.But I must admit the Goldfinch was the star of the show!","May 2, 2014"
"As the reviews marked terrible and poor, seem only to be written in Italian, we'd like to make you aware that there are but 2 Vermeer paintings. The Girl With The Pearl Earring and an early painting Diana & Her Nymphs. You may feel the victim of a marketing scam as many people did. To see the Vermeer go through the crowds, straight to last last painting. (Your ticket allows 20 mins viewing time) so why waste it? The Myth of the Golden Age seems an appropriate title. There are no good post cards to purchase and no mention anywhere of Tracy Chevalier whose book brought a great deal of interest to both the painting and Vermeer.","April 2, 2014"
"On loan from the Maurithuis Museum in the Hague ,the famous Vermeer Masterpiece is accompanied by a number of interesting paintings also from the Hague.Any chance to see these paintings is worth taking and there is more to see than in the recent similar exhibit held at the Frick in New York.The paintings are highlighted by spotlights while the rest of the rooms are in semi darkness(even the paintings's frames are in the shade).This method does not always work including for the Vermeer which was much better displayed at the Frick.On the other hand many works are at eye level and a joy to admire.Watch out for crowds and dreaded guided tours.","March 19, 2014"
"I visited for the art exhibition showing the famous Vermeer painting ""Girl with a pearl earring"". Queued outside having bought my ticket months in advance online and was shown in on time as the ""queue manager"" makes sure everyone gets in at the right time. Guided tour in Italian was excellent. Just 6 rooms could be visited which were those showing the exhibition. It was busy but not too much of a scrum. There were long lines for those without tickets but on the Sunday I went, there were 750 tickets for sale on the day. Everything has to be checked in even your purse so wear something with pockets you can put your valuables in.","March 11, 2014"
"Friends from Bologna were keen to show this museum.The building is beautifully restored with several important 20th century paintings and an exhibition on the ground floor. On the first floor is a cycle of Greek myths, very well explained on the interactive displays.","June 4, 2013"

"In Palazzo Fava we visited retrospective ""Moni Paralleli"" of Bologna-born painter Sergio Vacchi (1925-2016). This self-taught artist, with admiration for Giorgio de Chirico and Giorgio Morandi, Otto Dix and other artist, and inspired by contemporary authors and movie stars, had surrealistic approach, with 'own signature'. The exhibitition shows his approach towards the dual or parallel nature of the world. A great series of works demonstrate his research of Francis Bacon, Max Ernst, De Chirico, and his interest in portrait painting of people that inspired him (like Greta Garbo) as well as the investigation of the outside world that surround the human.

Comparatively speaking, I enjoyed the exhibition on Edward Hopper more. A ticket costs €10 (audioguide included), and with it, I got a €2 reduction when I visited the Storia di Bologna at Palazzo Pepoli (another Genus Bononiae venue).Recommended if there's an exhibition of interest to you.

"In Palazzo Fava we visited retrospective ""Moni Paralleli"" of Bologna-born painter Sergio Vacchi (1925-2016). This self-taught artist, with admiration for Giorgio de Chirico and Giorgio Morandi, Otto Dix and other artist, and inspired by contemporary authors and movie stars, had surrealistic approach, with 'own signature'. The exhibitition shows his approach towards the dual or parallel nature of the world. A great series of works demonstrate his research of Francis Bacon, Max Ernst, De Chirico, and his interest in portrait painting of people that inspired him (like Greta Garbo) as well as the investigation of the outside world that surround the human. Really worth a visit...to those interested in some surreal undertone in art.","October 16, 2018"
"Went there to see an exhibition on Edward Hopper 2 years ago when I visited Bologna. It was very good. Staff were very friendly. I also enjoyed coffee and some iced chocolate bar at the on site cafe there.This time, I went to see an exhibition on 'Metamorphosis - Zhang Dali'. Comparatively speaking, I enjoyed the exhibition on Edward Hopper more. A ticket costs €10 (audioguide included), and with it, I got a €2 reduction when I visited the Storia di Bologna at Palazzo Pepoli (another Genus Bononiae venue).Recommended if there's an exhibition of interest to you. You can check out the frescoes by the Carracci brothers, (famous Bolognese artists of the 16th century) there when you visit.","May 17, 2018"

A great series of works demonstrate his research of Francis Bacon, Max Ernst, De Chirico, and his interest in portrait painting of people that inspired him (like Greta Garbo) as well as the investigation of the outside world that surround the human.

"Went there to see an exhibition on Edward Hopper 2 years ago when I visited Bologna. It was very good. Staff were very friendly. I also enjoyed coffee and some iced chocolate bar at the on site cafe there.This time, I went to see an exhibition on 'Metamorphosis - Zhang Dali'. Comparatively speaking, I enjoyed the exhibition on Edward Hopper more. A ticket costs €10 (audioguide included), and with it, I got a €2 reduction when I visited the Storia di Bologna at Palazzo Pepoli (another Genus Bononiae venue).Recommended if there's an exhibition of interest to you. You can check out the frescoes by the Carracci brothers, (famous Bolognese artists of the 16th century) there when you visit.","May 17, 2018"

You can check out the frescoes by the Carracci brothers, (famous Bolognese artists of the 16th century) there when you visit.","May 17, 2018"
"We visited the Astrid Kirchherr with The Beatles exhibition on Saturday. The exhibition was wonderful with lots of great stories on the handheld set, which is included in the ticket price. The space is great. The staff were very friendly and informative. I will definitely be visiting future exhibitions here. Highly recommend a visit to the Astrid Kirchherr exhibition is you are in Bologna!","September 19, 2017"

"I'm relatively new to the world of early/mid 20th-century Italian art, but I love it, and therefore I was interested to see Costruire Il Novecento.What a wonderful exhibit! Beyond simply enjoying the paintings aesthetically, I was particularly happy to discover the work of Osvaldo Licini and to learn more about Giorgio Morandi and Carlo Carrà. In fact, one element I loved about this show was how much I learned via the (free) informative audio guide. Guests may listen to individual recordings for most paintings, and additional informational tracks are available for those wanting more background information about the artist. [As an aside, I will say I used the Italian language guide, but I'd be shocked if it wasn't available in English as well.] Each room also features dual Italian/English placards describing the artwork, artists and brief historical context.I was so happy with the exhibit, that I promptly bought the show catalogue at the gift shop. (Which, by the way, has a number of nice little ""gifts"" for the folks back home.)If you're looking for a pleasant way to spend an hour or so in Bologna, I highly recommend Costruire Il Novecento.P.S.

"I visited on the last day of the Edward Hopper exhibition facilitated by the Whitney Museum of American Art in Manhattan, and the 60 minute wait in the queue was absolutely worth it. The contrast between the superb Renaissance frescoes and ceiling above and Hopper's distinctive perspective and colours below were just stunning! I did not have time to visit the Medieval museum in the other wing but left a very happy man nonetheless. What a priceless space for art exhibitions ...","July 27, 2016"

"In Palazzo Fava we visited retrospective ""Moni Paralleli"" of Bologna-born painter Sergio Vacchi (1925-2016). This self-taught artist, with admiration for Giorgio de Chirico and Giorgio Morandi, Otto Dix and other artist, and inspired by contemporary authors and movie stars, had surrealistic approach, with 'own signature'. The exhibitition shows his approach towards the dual or parallel nature of the world. A great series of works demonstrate his research of Francis Bacon, Max Ernst, De Chirico, and his interest in portrait painting of people that inspired him (like Greta Garbo) as well as the investigation of the outside world that surround the human. Really worth a visit...to those interested in some surreal undertone in art.","October 16, 2018"
