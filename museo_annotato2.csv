negative;COLLECTION#GENERAL;;;There is not much to see.
negative;COLLECTION#SIZE;;;Only 3 exhibitions are open (as of the time I went) and they are all mostly boring. 
positive;COLLECTION#EGYPTIAN;;;The Egyptian exhibit was kind of cool
negative;STAFF#GENERAL;;;but the guard sitting in the building kept saying ‚Äúshh‚Äù to us when we were quietly talking and no one else was even in the exhibit!
negative;COLLECTION#SIZE;;; It is a very empty museum. 
negative;COLLECTION#ROMAN;;;The Roman exhibit is not worth seeing at all, as the statues are nothing special. 
negative;COLLECTION#GENERAL;;;The prehistoric exhibit is boring as well and again there is nothing to see aside from a collection of rocks from every country.
negative;LANGUAGE#AVAILABILITY;;; It might have been more interesting if there were English descriptions but there were none.
negative;MUSEUM#GENERAL;;; Definitely not worth seeing, don't waste your time. 
negative;COLLECTION#SIZE;;;Well, just 3 sections were available. 
positive;COLLECTION#EGYPTIAN;;; They do have good set of Egyptian collection. 
positive;COLLECTION#GENERAL;;;Pottery from prehistoric period with some items from the bronze could be seen as well. 
negative;COLLECTION#SIZE;;;Most part of the museum have been closed for restoration since 2017. As a result not much could be seen.
neutral;MUSEUM#GENERAL;;;We made a quick trip to the museum on a rainy day with our two young kids. 
positive;PRICE#GENERAL;;;Only part of the museum was open as they are renovating at the moment, but it was super cheap. 
positive;COLLECTION#EGYPTIAN;;;The best bit was the ancient Egypt section, which for a quick visit was pretty impressive. The kids thought it was fun too.
neutral;MUSEUM#GENERAL;;;The Museo Civico Archelogico is just that, a space dedicated to the many archeological wonders from Bologna's past. 
positive;COLLECTION#GENERAL;;;However, not only does the museum host a magnificent collection of artifacts and treasures, but it also has galleries dedicated to traveling exhibitions.
positive;EXHIBITION#HOKUSAI;;; At the time of my visit, this museum was showing the celebrated Hiroshige and Hosukai exhibition that had most recently been at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. The exhibition was beautifully mounted, nicely lit, and I really was lucky to see it. 
positive;MUSEUM#GENERAL;;;"Very fine.It was unfortunate that I was on a schedule, and couldn't enjoy the permanent exhibitions in this museum as I had to depart for Venice. I hope to return one day to see the rest of the museum. Enjoy.,""March 3, 2019"""
negative;COLLECTION#GENERAL;;;This museum apparently has a nice collection, but the way they present is is rather old fashioned - there appears not much to have happened in terms of renewing the exhibition since the 1980s or so. 
negative;INFORMATION#GENERAL;;;Too many fossils, too little context and information Ö
positive;EXHIBITION#HOKUSAI;;;The minute I walk in my hotel, I was happily surprised to find a leaflet informing about the Hokusai and Hiroshige exhibition! 
positive;EXHIBITION#HOKUSAI;;;Exhibition was a delight, but we only had the chance to see the ground floor of the museum, because the first floor was closed for renovations, so we didn't have the chance of admiring the Greek section
positive;EXHIBITION#HOKUSAI;;;Because these works require close-up attention to all the fascinating details, we only managed half of the Hokusai show in London. Exhaustion set in, so we were surprised and delighted to have an opportunity to continue. 
positive;EXHIBITION#HOKUSAI;;;It has all the famous prints, 36 views of Fuji, inc the Great Wave. Half the show is Hiroshige, who was less well-known to us. Not as funny as Hokusai, but equally fascinating.
negative;INFORMATION#GENERAL;;; We managed to see the pre-historic collection, some of which was really well presented and explained, including the Palaeolithic and the Etruscan, but some wasn't explained at all. 
neutral;COLLECTION#ROMAN;;;Never got to the Roman stuff. 
neutral;COLLECTION#EGYPTIAN;;;When we attended, only the ancient Egyptian area was open. We were warned.
negative;LANGUAGE#AVAILABILITY;;;Minimal explanation of exhibits are offered in English. For me, this provided an opportunity to read some Italian and to test my own powers of observation. However, it became frustrating after awhile. This is fine for a 30 minute visit, but don't go out of your way.
negative;COLLECTION#EGYPTIAN;;;Much of this was undergoing renovations so the main sections were off limits & you have to be content with the Egyptian displays which anyone who has seen the Tutankhamun exhibition will probably find boring we did!!Check before you go in & pay what is open!!
positive;PRICE#GENERAL;;;I came here to see the Egyptian Collection and for 3 euros your in for a treat. 
neutral;MUSEUM#GENERAL;;;Some of the museum floors are closed for restoration but the basement which houses the Egyptian Artifacts is still open. 
negative;LANGUAGE#AVAILABILITY;;;Very well set out although most labels are in Italian.  
positive;COLLECTION#EGYPTIAN;;;The stunning Stelae of Pharoah Horemheb, are the first thing you see then it is set out in Kingdoms through the ages. Stunning Sarcophagi and statues as well as papyri and even crocodiles.
positive;GIFT_SHOP#GENERAL;;;Quite a nice little gift shop books on the collection are only found with Italian language but still worth a look. Imo not to be missed!!
neutral;COLLECTION#EGYPTIAN;;;The Etruscan and Roman rooms were closed when I went there due to some constructions and repairing. However the Egyptian room was opened. 
positive;COLLECTION#EGYPTIAN;;;They have a huge collection with mummies and sarcophagus, papyrus and sculptures. 
positive;PRICE#GENERAL;;;It was highly worth going and the entrance fee was only 3 euros. 
neutral;MUSEUM#GENERAL;;;It takes around 1:30 hours to see everything. 
negative;LANGUAGE#AVAILABILITY;;;The only problem is the language texts, everything has Italian description and an English translation except the Italian main history texts which are quite interesting.
NaN;NaN;;;In Italy, you get used to: roman artefacts are just a litter on streets - you walk through Rome, trip over some rock and find out it is not a rock, it is a nose of a statue of Marcus Aurelius, but whatever... Medieval things are so common, they have them on display on streets - you go to a hotel and see a suit of armor, go to a restaurant and see a mace or a sword... And if there are not roman things, there are etruscan, piceno, sabino, etc. You'll get sick of it so quickly... But what can you do when it is 41¬∞C outside and 80% humidity? You go to a airconned museum. 
positive;MUSEUM#GENERAL;;;We went there just to cool off and found a gem. 
positive;PRICE#GENERAL;;;Firstly, the entry is 6 euro. That is fairly low considering other museums in major Italian cities.
positive;PRICE#GENERAL;;;Like in Florence, there is a flat rate for museums 10 euro... But here, 6 euro, well, great!
positive;COLLECTION#EGYPTIAN;;;"Then we heard ""you can start left, with our EGYPTIAN exposition""... EXCUSE ME?! Did you say EGYPTIAN?! Was my reaction. "
positive;COLLECTION#EGYPTIAN;;;Surely there are just some few unimportant and badly preserved artifacts, this is Bologna in the end, not really known for their rich EGYPTIAN exposition... But no. We were AMAZED when we saw it. 
positive;COLLECTION#EGYPTIAN;;; It is not big, but it is beautiful and rich. There are frescoes, statuettes, pergamens in demotic and hieroglyfic writing, there are mummies, coffins, canopic jars, amulets, etc, etc. The collection goes as far as the old kingdom. 
positive;PRICE#GENERAL;;; I was not expecting such a collection from some civic museum in Bologna(not really a tourist center of Italy, I was pleased when I got off the train from Florence, compared to it there is just negligible number of tourists in Bologna) for just 6‚Ç¨! 
neutral;COLLECTION#ETRUSCAN;;;And we also saw some Etruscan collection and a portion of it was closed off but I don't care! 
positive;COLLECTION#EGYPTIAN;;;I saw the EGYPTIAN exhibition, my heart of lover of ancient egypt was pleased and I was fully satisfied just with this exhibition alone.
neutral;MUSEUM#GENERAL;;;This museum is nothing very special, 
positive;COLLECTION#GENERAL;;;but for the lovers of archaeology the collection provides enough beautiful artefacts to come out satisfied
NaN;NaN;;;The museum is right opposite St Peter's Cathedral and Neptune's Fountain. 
neutral;MUSEUM#GENERAL;;;The museum is much larger than the building appears. 
positive;MUSEUM#GENERAL;;;Our young child was really interested and helped as an incentive of seeing another monument and churchù! 
negative;STAFF#GENERAL;;;Miserable staff , unhelpful and rude which was a great shame. 
negative;PRICE#GENERAL;;;Expensive at 6 euros , and dusty and unloved 
neutral;MUSEUM#GENERAL;;;Near the Basilica of San Petronio, at the heart of the city, you‚Äôll find the Archeological City Museum. 
positive;MUSEUM#GENERAL;;;What an interesting museum ‚Äì this gives you a fantastic insight into the history of the city throughout the ages. 
neutral;COLLECTION#GENERAL;;;There is a little bit of everything here: Prehistoric, Etruscan, Celtic, Greek, Roman, Egyptian, and Numismatic. 
positive;COLLECTION#GENERAL;;;Each collection has a fantastic display of different artefacts. 
positive;COLLECTION#GENERAL;;;We were especially taken with the collection of Egyptian antiquities. It is one of the most important in Europe, the second in Italy, for historical and artistic quality, conservative state, and number of objects (about 4,000). The numismatic collection, of great value, has over 100,000 objects. 
positive;MUSEUM#GENERAL;;;This is a museum not to be missed.
positive;COLLECTION#GENERAL;;;Solid Egyptian collection,extensive Etruscan collection (the best i have seen).
negative;EXHIBITION#GENERAL;;;Some of the parts were closed because there were preparations for new exhibit about(i believe that new exhibit is about benefactors of this museum during its history and therefore i believe it will be more interesting to domestic people than to tourists.
negative;COLLECTION#GENERAL;;;Nothing of much importance here.
neutral;COLLECTION#ETRUSCAN;;;A collection of pre Roman Etruscan vases, and bits and pieces.
negative;COLLECTION#ROMAN;;;Some Roman artifacts of no major interest (road mileage markers......).
negative;COLLECTION#EGYPTIAN;;;And an Egyptian collection , of no international importance ( some sarcophagi, minor statues, etc).
positive;MUSEUM#GENERAL;;;Very interesting archaeological museum. 
positive;COLLECTION#EGYPTIAN;;;Currently, one floor is in reconstruction, but in the basement there is a very interesting exhibition about ancient Egypt.
positive;MUSEUM#GENERAL;;;This museum is fairly interesting and well laid out, although not typical by any means.
negative;COLLECTION#EGYPTIAN;;;I really liked the local items but found the Egyptian collection a bit less interesting given the are so many other event Egyptian collections around the world.
positive;MUSEUM#GENERAL;;;"Nice museum, very modern (especially in comparison to other Bologna museums ;)) with big ancient egypt collection. "
positive;STAFF#GENERAL;;;Nice staff, front desk was speaking english (other staff not really, but it was not problematic). 
negative;LANGUAGE#AVAILABILITY;;;Unfortunately museum catalogue was only in italian 
negative;STAFF#GENERAL;;;and there was no one in the shop to ask about and even pay for sth. 
positive;COLLECTION#EGYPTIAN;;;Really enjoyed the Egyptian exhibition. 
negative;INFORMATION#GENERAL;;;Some more detail on the exhibits, especially in the courtyard would earn a 5 stars.
positive;COLLECTION#GENERAL;;;Very good archeological exhibits although there were areas under renovation and finding way round a bit complex but wothwhile
positive;STAFF#GENERAL;;;When I went to pay for my ticket, the charming young lady at the reception desk advised me that the first floor of the museum was closed for renovation but the Roman Lapidarium on the ground floor and the Egyptian Collection in the basement were open and did I still want to buy my ticket? 
positive;COLLECTION#EGYPTIAN;;;The main museum was closed for renovation which I'm guessing will be closed for some time but the ancient Egyptian collection in the basement was really interesting. Lots of little treasures I've not seen in other ancient Egyptian exhibitions. Although small, it's definitely worth seeing. Very interesting! 
positive;COLLECTION#GENERAL;;;Well, being quite a fan of both the Egyptian and Roman civilisations, I went for it and I'm very glad I did! 
negative;INFORMATION#GENERAL;;;I started off in the lovely courtyard examining the Roman artifacts, statuary and inscription tablets (information in English is a bit sparse!) and continued in the rather grand entrance hall. 
;COLLECTION#EGYPTIAN;;;" I then went down into the basement; the Egyptian artifacts are beautifully presented and lit, with descriptions in Italian and English although sometimes you have to search for them. I think it is one of the best collections I have seen and quite unexpected to find in Bologna! "
NaN;NaN;;;"A bonus is being able to watch the experts painstakingly restoring a painted mummy case!Perhaps on a future visit, the first floor renovations will be complete but knowing Italian renovations, I suspect that might be a few years in the future!,""November 5, 2017"""
positive;COLLECTION#EGYPTIAN;;;Only the Egyptian wing of this museum was open when we were there. It is really well presented and their collection is well labeled and easy to view. Highly recommend it if this is of interest to you.
positive;COLLECTION#EGYPTIAN;;;When we visited the museum, a large part was not available for the public. Even so, we really enjoyed the Egyptian collection. 
positive;MUSEUM#GENERAL;;;Spent a good few hours in the museum one afternoon and had came upon it by chance. Really worth the vist and would highly recommend. If you take a bag they will ask you to leave it in a locker. It was not a problem.
positive;MUSEUM#GENERAL;;;We bought a three day ticket from the Tourist Office which gave free entry to zillions of museums and we started with this one. We hired headphones and guided commentary...finding the numbers is sometimes a fun game! The exhibits are really interesting, though rather a lot of Etruscan vases, and help to show the evolution of the city, and the cultures of the inhabitants. Some really beautiful pieces and we felt that we were rushhing through parts of it as there is so much. It would probably benefit from at least a half day and probably two half days.
